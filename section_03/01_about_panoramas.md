# About Panoramas

Panorama is something I always love. Not because that it grants me more details - as mentioend by some other photographers, that you get all the center-quality image parts as you stitch your photos, and that means you wouldn't see much artifacts, since the image part produced by the center of a lens is always good enough. But is that the only good part? I mean, usually you are not doing large-format printing, and therefore cropping using a wide-angle lens would suffice. So why bother with stitching photos, which could fail according to a lot of factors like parallax and moving objects? It seems too much of a burden. What is so special about stitching photos?

Previously I thought that it is only because you want some more information in the image - for example, when you are shooting an architecture, you probably want to include its overall structure and its textures at the same time - that is, the macro view and the micro view. If you use a wide angle lens, you would capture the structure, while losing texture info. Or you are using a telephoto lens, which only gives you a glance at a small portion of the architecture. Under such circumstances, stitching the photos seems to be the right choice - you could capture both the structure while preserving the details.

That is, of course, the initial intention of not only mine, but also a large number of others'. However, as I shoot along, the accumulation of panoramas I stitched enlightened me of something else - something I didn't even notice before when I was using zoom lenses - that I am relying on my eyes more and more, instead of staring at the view finder to find something probably I wanted. It suddenly occured to me that I am not having a feeling for a long time - the feeling of something not being right when compositing photos in the view finder: maybe the shoreline I want to include is too long, and therefore I have to use a shorter focal length, and when I actually switched to a wider angle view, again I feel maybe the sky is taking too large of a portion in the photo. I just cannot find the precise, exact scene I want in the viewfinder: it enforces me to think in a 2:3 way (in medium format, it is 4:5), and unconsciously I incline to be unsatisfied with a photo if it doesn't seem right in the view finder, although after cropping, it might be of amusement.

But stitching panorama is a rather different thing - you gain the freedom of compositing as you wish, with some tiny defects - that you might not be able to visualize it in your camera. Some people might feel it inconvenient, and I shall agree with them, but it seems to me that we have forgotten the best visualizer we have, as well as the initial cause of the invention of cameras, our eyes. Why would people take photos? Because we see something, and we would like to capture the moment - we see something. What a beautiful word: to see! And we capture things, because we see; We don't feel right with the view finder, because we see! We could like to capture the thing we have in mind, without our thoughts being twisted by the view finder. And here we are: without seeing things in the view finder, we again picked up our old instinct: to see through our eyes, and composite as the picture in our mind. I want the long coast line without too much of the sky, OK! Just capture the coast line by doing a horizontal panorama. I want the peak of Mont Blanc extending to the arch up there, Sure! We do a series of vertical shoots! And after we collected all the pieces we want, the painting in our heart awaits.

## Lens Choices

Ever since I adopted the technique of panorama stitching, I hardly use zoom lenses any more. Why would I bother with a zoom lens, should I knew I would not composite my photo using the zooming functionality? I could always composite the view I want by stitching pieces - if not enough, just add more pieces. I could stitch until a 360 degree sphere if I wish to. Another thing I almost gave up on was the wide angle lenses, according to the fact I stated previously. However, I could not completely ditch wide-angle lenses away, because sometimes you just need to trade space for time - that is to say, star trails, specifically. But that is some rare occasion, and you can tell by seeing what tech specs those ultra wide angle lenses have - have you ever seen a 14mm f5.6? No, because people buying 14mm prime would definitely go shooting stars or the milky way.

Then what kind of lenses would I recommend for stitching panoramas? Well, that is a tough question and hthe answer ighly depends on the kind of photos you would like to take. Do you enjoy shooting things in a short distance and try to emphasize on its size compared to something that is distant away? Or do you prefer to shoot something that is on the horizon, and you like formats like 617? The former one I would recommend using 35mm, while for the latter I would go for something like 85mm or 135mm. Saying so, a 50mm is always something you can not go wrong. Although you would definitely get a 35mm or 85mm afterwards, as you develop deeper into your own taste. 

## Accessories

I would recommend at least a tripod and a nodal slide, although I often do the panorama with bare hands - especially when I am using a telephoto lens. However, without a nodal slide and a tripod, it is highly probable that you will not be rotating the camera around its nodal point - causing parallax to appear. If you are using something like 85mm, usually the parallax are not so noticable, and sometimes can be ignored. But if you are dealing with wider angle lenses, especially those <= 35mm ones, then you could run into big troubles. Without manually eliminating the parallax, you wouldn't be able to stitch the images, or you might not be able to preserve the perspective, should you choose to stitch using rectanglinear projection. But hey you are stitching something into a ultra-wide image, I suppose you would definitely want to try the perspective projection?

The reason I do not suggest hand-held is that if you rotate the camera as you usually do - that is, to rotate it around the body, you would 100% miss the nodal point:

And this could actually cause such a result:

Assume you were the stitcher and you saw the above example, would you know how to stitch the images? I guess not! And always remember that machines are usually more stupid than us, so please please think from the machine's perspective and try to provide photos with less parallax so that it can do the job for you.

In order to setup the nodal slide, just try different positions of a certain lens and mark the position where you witness almost no parallax when you rotate the camera, and that should do.

## Exposure

It is easy to decide the exposure of a photo with all those modern tools, with built-in light meters, with all the light metering modes, and high-speed chips; it makes things so easy for us that when it comes to shooting multiple photos and stitching them together, metering the light becomes such a non-trivial thing, that we either go Auto mode and make color blending in the photos seem so unnatural, or we go directly into Manual mode, as suggested by some online posts - which is the correct way to go - but only take the first photo as reference and get completely over/under-exposed images for the following sequences, introducing a lot of noises or losing highlight details.

The way I do light metering is pretty much inspired by Ansel Adams' zone theory - that you arrange your scene into different brightness zones, but instead of arranging them into ten brightness level, I prefer to arrange them into their absolute brightness denoted by EV value. The first thing I do before metering is framing the image, of course; and I will find the brightest spot and darkest spot according to my experience, then use the spot metering mode and calculate the brightness EV value using the given ISO, aperture and shutter speed. Once I get the brightness EV value of the darkest spot and brightest spot, I will take their mean EV value and translate it into aperture, ISO and shutter speed, and that shall be my reference exposure.

For example, currently I have ISO set to 100, Aperture being F4.0, and I get the shutter speed as 16" for the darkest spot, while I have the shutter speed as 1/200" for the brightest spot, that makes the EV values 0EV and 11.67 EV respectively. Their mean is at around 5.8 EV, which I round to 6 EV, giving me the new shutter speed as 1/4", and I shall expose all the photos using this shutter speed.

Now a new question pops up - what if the darkest spot and brightest spot have such a difference, for example, 20EV difference, while our camera only have a dynamic range of 16EV?

Where, that is where HDR bracketing pops in, and I guess you know how to do it. The reference exposure remains the same, though. In the example I mentioned just now, say we have the darkest spot of 0 EV and brightest spot as 20 EV, we will set the exposure to be the one corresponding to 10 EV, and enable HDR bracketing of +/- 3EV. In this case,  the reference image would capture information between 2.0EV to 18.0EV, the darker one would capture the information from 5.0EV to 21.0EV, while the brigher one would capture information of -1.0EV to 15.0 EV. Once you combine them together, you have information from -1.0EV until 21.0EV.

## Regarding Imaging

Panorama itself can be useful in another case, and that is, to maintain the perspective you want to. It allows you to perform effectively a shift without needing a tilt-shift lens and technical cameras.

One question I faced before was that how come those illustrations can prompt me with an organized feeling, and further lead me to the thing the author would like me to see?

I bore the question with me for a long time, until someday I suddenly developed an interest in tilt-shift and learned about its effects, and something occured to me. A lot of photos - they prompt an organized feeling, because they are organized in a way. The most obvious example would be architecture photography - they have so little portion of the ground scene while so much of the architecture itself, and preserving the parallel lines of the architecture. Here is an example:

We found the left image more amusing because it is organized - it preserves the perspective. Advanced panorama stiching software like PTGUI and Hugin allows you to change the view point toward a panorama by manipulating the projection, and hence manipulate the perspective. Usually you would get a more amusing image by using panorama stitching than by using tilt-shift lenses, because you do not face the optical defects of a physical lens at its rim. This is rather helpful when you shoot architecture and, in my opinion, portraits sometimes.

## Brenizer's Method

Another good thing about panorama is that it is effectively allowing you to use an "ideal" lens of very large effective aperture with a very large format - which means you can get a super shallow depth of field while maintaining a fairly large field of view - and that is something you could barely achieve without a large format camera during the age of films. But thanks to the technology and digitalization, we now can "mimic" such photos by using panorama stitching!

The secret behind this is that
