# Introduction

Since my first post came to live, I shared it with some of my friends and try to grasp some suggestions so that I could better structure the posts that I am going to write. One advice, which I feel very useful, is that I should have a clear target audience and do not assume that the target audience knows everything. This is something absolutely right, and it inspired me to write this post regarding the basic information of digital photography.

This post includes my "revisit" to those fundamentals of digital photography. It might just like whatever you read on the other websites - it is about the technical specs. If you are already very familiar with all these, you may just skip this post cause it might not be of too much for you. But if you find it difficult to read my other posts, you might find this post rather helpful.

## Using Your Camera

I do not intend to talk too much in this section, since your user manual shall be your best teacher on how to use your camera - it has almost everything you nead. However, I always found beginners drowning in the terminologies like Aperture First, Exposure Compensation, etc. Therefore, I want to briefly go through the common aspects a digital camera would have nowadays.
